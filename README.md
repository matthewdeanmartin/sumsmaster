A Python project with quality gates

## Installation

```bash
pipx install sumsmaster
```

Or with pip:

```bash
pip install sumsmaster
```

## Usage

```bash
sumsmaster --help
sumsmaster tricks     # list the trick taxonomy
sumsmaster coverage   # trick-coverage report over the fact space
sumsmaster gui        # graphical app: profiles, plans, practice, progress
```

The GUI (also installed as `sumsmaster-gui`) is the free, self-hosted
edition: local unauthenticated profiles stored under `~/.sumsmaster/`, plan
selection, trick-weighted practice with mastery tracking, and pause/resume.
It needs tkinter, which ships with CPython on Windows/macOS; on Debian/Ubuntu
install `python3-tk`.
